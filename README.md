# Hive Showdown (CryptoCombat)
By Team Houdini

In the dynamic landscape of online gaming, innovation is the key to capturing players' imaginations and keeping them engaged. Enter our groundbreaking blockchain-based gaming platform, poised to transform the way gamers experience virtual adventures. Our platform offers an unparalleled blend of immersive gameplay, decentralized technology, and real-world incentives, all centered around the adrenaline-pumping thrill of close combat battles.

Players stake their HIVE cryptocurrencies, equivalent to the resources they wish to bring to the battlefield. This introduces an element of strategy and risk, as the amount staked directly influences the power and capabilities of their in-game avatar. Blockchain technology ensures that every battle is fair and transparent, with outcomes determined by performance relative to the stakes.

Moreover, our platform offers an unparalleled level of immersion, thanks to cutting-edge graphics, responsive controls, and seamless multiplayer functionality. Whether you're a seasoned warrior or a novice adventurer, our intuitive interface makes it easy to jump into the action and experience the thrill of battle like never before.

Players are rewarded based on their performance relative to their stakes, ensuring that skill and strategy are duly recognized and incentivized.

Authentication and Funds Verification: We prioritize security and fairness by integrating HIVE Keychain login, ensuring that players are authenticated and have sufficient funds for the minimum bid before entering the fray.
Backend Reward Management: Behind the scenes, a robust Node JS server seamlessly interacts with the HIVE blockchain to handle reward distribution, ensuring that players receive their rightful earnings in a transparent and efficient manner.
Multiplayer Functionality: Experience the thrill of multiplayer battles with our peer-to-peer game design, facilitated by a relay server that accommodates up to six players per room. Prepare to test your skills against worthy adversaries from around the globe.

Resource Allocation Algorithm: Harness the power of strategic bidding with our innovative sigmoid function, which dynamically allocates resources based on player buy-in. The higher your bid, the greater your power and hit damage, giving you a decisive edge in the heat of battle.

Integrating Unity3D with the HIVE blockchain presented several formidable challenges for our development team. First and foremost, there was a glaring absence of a software development kit (SDK) specifically tailored for Unity applications to interact with the HIVE blockchain. This posed a significant hurdle as it meant that we had to devise alternative methods to establish communication between Unity3D and the blockchain.

We opted to utilize a WebGL build for the Unity application. By deploying our game to a web browser environment, we gained access to crucial browser extensions that could facilitate blockchain interaction. To tap into the browser's capabilities, we employed jslib within the Unity environment. This powerful tool enabled us to execute browser scripting directly from Unity, opening up a realm of possibilities for seamless integration with external technologies. With jslib in place, our next step was to leverage browser extensions that could bridge the gap between Unity and the HIVE blockchain. Specifically, we utilized the hive-keychain extension's robust APIs, which provided the necessary functionalities for interacting with HIVE transactions securely and efficiently.

In implementing this application, we learned about Hive Blockchain Integration with Unity. This process requires understanding both the Unity game development environment and the Hive blockchain ecosystem. We learned how to utilize APIs and libraries to connect Unity applications with the Hive blockchain, allowing for functionalities such as user authentication, asset management, and transaction processing within the game environment. We also learned a lot about Multiplayer Unity3D Game Development.
